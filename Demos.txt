    This demo features a video displaying a primitive version of our floor detector. During this stage of development, the program counts the number of white pixels seen on each button in order to determine the state of the button. It states that the floor corresponding to that button has been reached when the white pixel count drops by an amount that has been hard coded. The idea behind this implementation is that the white pixel count decreases when the light on the button turns off. It is evident that this method will not work well due to the fact that when people move within the elevator, or even the elevator door opens, the lighting changes and can give false positives. For example, the elevator button corresponding to floor seven changes quite a bit whenever the door opens. This is why it incorrectly states that floor seven has been reached multiple times. The program also only checks to see if the floor has been reached by checking when the lights turn off. Thus, when the elevator reaches the bottom floor and there are still buttons pressed for the floors above it, the elevator resets the buttons and the program is tricked into thinking that it has simultaneously reached all the floors whose buttons were previously lit.
